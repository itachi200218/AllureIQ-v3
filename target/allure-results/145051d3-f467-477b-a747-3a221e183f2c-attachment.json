        "steps": "Step 1: Marinate the Chicken\nClean and pat dry the chicken pieces with a paper towel.\nIn a large bowl, mix buttermilk, salt, pepper, and paprika.\nAdd the chicken pieces to the bowl, ensuring they are fully submerged in the buttermilk. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (overnight for the best results). This step helps tenderize the chicken and adds flavor.\nStep 2: Prepare the Seasoned Flour\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine flour, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and black pepper.\nMix well to ensure the spices are evenly distributed in the flour. This will be your crispy coating.\nStep 3: Coat the Chicken\nRemove the chicken pieces from the buttermilk marinade. Let the excess buttermilk drip off.\nDredge each piece in the seasoned flour, pressing lightly to ensure the flour sticks. Shake off excess flour and place the coated chicken on a plate.\nFor an extra-crispy coating, you can repeat this process by dipping the chicken back into the buttermilk and coating it in the flour again.\nStep 4: Fry the Chicken\nHeat oil in a deep pan or fryer to 175°C (350°F). Make sure there’s enough oil to fully submerge the chicken.\nFry the chicken in batches. Avoid overcrowding the pan to maintain the oil temperature.\nCook each piece for 10–12 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy. The internal temperature should reach 75°C (165°F) when tested with a meat thermometer.\nTransfer the fried chicken to a wire rack or paper towels to drain the excess oil.\nStep 5: Serve and Enjoy\nServe the fried chicken hot with your favorite dipping sauces like ranch, honey mustard, or barbecue sauce. It pairs well with mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or cornbread for a full Southern meal.\n\n",

        "steps": "Here's a step-by-step guide to making perfect Pooris:\n\n**Ingredients You'll Need:**\n\n*   2 cups whole wheat flour (atta)\n*   1/2 teaspoon salt\n*   1 tablespoon oil (for the dough)\n*   Water (as needed, lukewarm)\n*   Oil for deep frying\n\n**Preparation Steps:**\n\n1.  **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt. Mix well.\n\n2.  **Add Oil and Mix:** Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the flour mixture. Rub the oil into the flour with your fingertips until the flour feels slightly moist and holds its shape when pressed. This helps to create a crispier poori.\n\n3.  **Add Water Gradually:** Start adding lukewarm water little by little, mixing it into the flour. Knead the dough well, adding water until it comes together into a firm, non-sticky dough.  The dough should be tighter than a chapati dough.\n\n4.  **Knead the Dough:** Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes. This develops the gluten and makes the pooris puff up better. The dough should be smooth and elastic.\n\n5.  **Rest the Dough:** Cover the dough with a damp cloth or a lid and let it rest for at least 15-20 minutes.  Resting the dough allows the gluten to relax, making it easier to roll out.\n\n6.  **Prepare for Rolling:** Divide the dough into small, equal-sized portions (about 1 inch in diameter). Roll each portion into a smooth ball.\n\n7.  **Roll Out the Pooris:** On a lightly floured surface (or using a rolling board), gently roll out each dough ball into a small, circular disc. Aim for a diameter of about 3-4 inches.  Keep the thickness even – not too thick, not too thin.  If the dough sticks, lightly dust with flour.\n\n8. **Heat the Oil:** While you are rolling the pooris, heat enough oil in a deep frying pan (kadai) or wok over medium-high heat. The oil should be hot enough to cook the pooris quickly and allow them to puff up. Test the oil by dropping a tiny piece of dough into it. If it rises to the surface quickly and sizzles, the oil is ready.\n\n9.  **Fry the Pooris:** Gently slide a rolled-out poori into the hot oil.\n\n10. **Puffing Up:** As soon as the poori starts to float on the surface, gently press it down with a slotted spoon or spatula. This encourages it to puff up fully.\n\n11. **Cook Until Golden:** Fry the poori until it is golden brown on both sides. Turn it over once or twice to ensure even cooking. This will take about 1-2 minutes per side.\n\n12. **Drain and Serve:** Remove the fried poori from the oil using a slotted spoon and place it on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil.\n\n13. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 7-12 with the remaining dough balls.\n\n14. **Serve Hot:** Serve the pooris hot with your favorite side dishes, such as potato curry, chana masala, or raita.\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade Pooris!\n",

        "steps": "Okay, here are the step-by-step instructions for making butter dosa:\n\n**Step 1: Prepare the Dosa Batter (Ideally, do this a day in advance)**\n\n1.  **Soak the Rice and Lentils:** In a large bowl, combine 3 cups of raw rice (dosa rice or regular rice), 1 cup of urad dal (split black lentils, skinned), and 1 teaspoon of fenugreek seeds. Wash them thoroughly 2-3 times until the water runs clear.\n2.  **Soak Separately (Optional):** You can also soak 1/2 cup of poha (flattened rice) separately for 30 minutes before grinding. This helps make the dosa softer.\n3.  **Soak in Water:** Add enough fresh water to completely cover the rice and lentils.  Soak for at least 4-6 hours, or preferably overnight (8-10 hours). The longer the soak, the better the fermentation.\n4.  **Grind the Rice and Lentils:** Drain the soaked rice and lentils. Add them to a grinder or blender in batches. Use the soaking water to grind, adding only enough to create a smooth, flowing batter.  Grind until you achieve a fine, smooth consistency.  The batter should be slightly thick but pourable. If using poha, add it during the last batch and grind until incorporated.\n5.  **Combine and Ferment:** Pour the ground batter into a large bowl. Add salt to taste (usually about 1-2 teaspoons). Mix very well with your hand (this helps with fermentation due to the warmth).\n6.  **Ferment the Batter:** Cover the bowl loosely and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or until the batter has doubled in volume and has a slightly sour aroma.  The fermentation time will vary depending on the temperature.\n\n**Step 2: Prepare the Dosa Making Area**\n\n7.  **Prepare Ingredients:** Have the dosa batter ready.  Have butter readily available (cubed for easier application). Have a small bowl of water for adjusting the pan temperature.  Have a clean, damp cloth or paper towels.\n8.  **Heat the Pan:** Place a flat, non-stick tawa (griddle) or frying pan over medium-high heat.  The pan needs to be hot enough for the dosa to cook properly but not so hot that it burns immediately.\n\n**Step 3: Make the Butter Dosa**\n\n9.  **Check Pan Temperature:** Sprinkle a few drops of water on the hot tawa. If the water sizzles and evaporates quickly, the pan is ready. If the water just sits there, the pan is not hot enough. If the water splatters violently and burns off immediately, the pan is too hot.\n10. **Grease the Pan Lightly (First Dosa Only):** Lightly grease the pan with a small amount of oil or ghee (clarified butter) for the first dosa to ensure it doesn't stick.  This may not be necessary with a well-seasoned non-stick pan.\n11. **Pour the Batter:** Lower the heat to medium.  Using a ladle, pour one ladleful of batter onto the center of the hot tawa.\n12. **Spread the Batter:** Immediately use the back of the ladle to spread the batter in a circular motion, starting from the center and moving outwards, to form a thin, even circle.\n13. **Add Butter:** Immediately after spreading the batter, place small cubes of butter around the edges and in the center of the dosa. The amount of butter depends on how rich you want it to be.\n14. **Cook the Dosa:** Cook the dosa for 2-3 minutes, or until the bottom turns golden brown and the edges start to lift from the pan.\n15. **Flip (Optional):** For a crispier dosa, you can flip it over and cook for another minute on the other side.  This is optional; some people prefer to only cook one side.\n16. **Fold or Roll:** Use a spatula to gently loosen the dosa from the pan. Fold it in half or roll it up.\n17. **Serve Immediately:** Serve the butter dosa hot with sambar, chutney (coconut chutney, tomato chutney, etc.), and/or podi (gunpowder).\n\n**Step 4: Repeat**\n\n18. **Clean the Pan (If Needed):** After each dosa, you may need to quickly wipe the pan with a clean, damp cloth or paper towel to remove any excess batter or residue. This helps prevent the subsequent dosas from sticking or burning.\n19. **Adjust Heat:** Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a consistent cooking temperature.\n20. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 11-17 to make the remaining dosas.\n\n**Tips for Success:**\n\n*   **Batter Consistency:** The batter consistency is crucial. If it's too thick, the dosa will be thick and pancake-like. If it's too thin, it will be difficult to spread.\n*   **Pan Temperature:** Maintaining the right pan temperature is key.\n*   **Fermentation:** Proper fermentation is essential for a light and airy dosa.\n*   **Fresh Butter:** Use good quality butter for the best flavor.\n*   **Practice:** Making dosas takes a little practice. Don't be discouraged if your first few attempts aren't perfect.\n\nEnjoy your homemade butter dosa!\n",
